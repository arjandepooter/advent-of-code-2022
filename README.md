# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions in Python. To run the solutions make sure you have `python 3.11` and `poetry` installed. Run `./aoc run <day>` to run the solution with my input (which is stored in `inputs/`) for the specified day. To run it with another input add it to the command where `-` can be used to read from `stdin`: `./aoc run <day> <file>`.

## Results
